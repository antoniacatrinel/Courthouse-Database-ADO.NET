# Courthouse Database ADO.NET

# [Courthouse Database](https://github.com/antoniacatrinel/Courthouse-Database-ADO.NET/tree/main/Courthouse%20Database)

TSQL database used for managing a courthouse (judges, prosecutors, attorneys, court rooms, trails, cases, lawsuits, evidence, staff etc.).

# [Courthouse Database ADO.NET](https://github.com/antoniacatrinel/Courthouse-Database-ADO.NET/tree/main/Courthouse%20WindowsForms%20ADO.NET)

Create a **C# Windows Forms** application that uses **ADO.NET** to interact with your database. The application must contain a form allowing the user to manipulate data in 2 tables that are in a 1:n relationship (parent table and child table). The application must provide the following functionalities:
- display all the records in the parent table;
- display the child records for a specific (i.e., selected) parent record;
- `add` / `remove` / `update` child records for a specific parent record.

The application should dynamically create the master-detail windows form. The form caption and stored procedures / queries used to access and manipulate data will be set in a configuration file.

The two different scenarios handling data from two different 1:n relationships can be found in the configuration file.

The form should be generic enough such that switching between scenarios (i.e., updating the application to handle data from another 1:n relationship) can be achieved by simply updating the configuration file.

# [Courthouse Database Concurrent Transactions](https://github.com/antoniacatrinel/Courthouse-Database-ADO.NET/tree/main/Courthouse%20Database%20Concurrent%20Transactions)

Prepare the following scenarios for your database:

- create a stored procedure that inserts data in tables that are in a m:n relationship; if one insert fails, all the operations performed by the procedure must be rolled back;
- create a stored procedure that inserts data in tables that are in a m:n relationship; if an insert fails, try to recover as much as possible from the entire operation: for example, if the user wants to add a book and its authors, succeeds creating the authors, but fails with the book, the authors should remain in the database;
- reproduce the following **concurrency issues** under pessimistic isolation levels: `dirty reads`, `non-repeatable reads`, `phantom reads`, and a `deadlock` (4 different scenarios); you can use stored procedures and / or stand-alone queries; find solutions to solve / workaround the concurrency issues;
reproduce the update conflict under an optimistic isolation level.

Prepare test cases covering both the happy scenarios and the ones with errors (this applies to stored procedures).

Donâ€™t use IDs as input parameters for your stored procedures. Validate all parameters (try to use functions when needed).

Setup a logging system to track executed actions for all scenarios and handle all errors.
